output o_valid when it has been fully processed

o_edge was there an edge in that convolution table

o_dir which direction 

o_mode  what mode is the circ in 
idle  “10”  - not doing anything
busy  “11”  - recieving pixels and processing
reset “01”  - wil stay this so long as reset = 1, then goes to idle


for pixels on the perimeter of the image, no output should be asserted
 - o_edge and o_dir should be 0 with o_valid = 1

o_row row number of the input image
o_col col number of the input image


should be able to take in consecutive images

o_row should remain 255 until the next pixel arrives or reset is set

add check when consuming input to see whether o_row value should be reset
 - have internal var that is 1 when o_row should be reset on next pixel
